		"description": "D3no Data is a pioneering data visualization and charting library crafted specifically for the Deno runtime environment. At its inception, Deno's unique ecosystem lacked access to npm libraries, presenting a void in terms of charting and data visualization tools. Recognizing this, our team leveraged D3.js to curate a lightweight library, offering a plethora of functionalities and a high degree of customizability for chart visualizations.",
